## **AI Sovereignty**

We need Dutch companies that not only build AI applications but can also train and customize their own AI models. These companies should supply crucial systems to our government, defense, and businesses. The French recognized this early on and now have three AI startups collectively worth over 10 billion. One of them, Mistral, creates 'Le Chat', a direct competitor to ChatGPT.

Sovereignty means ownership of the technology that forms the foundation of our future. It's not just about using AI, but about understanding, developing, and controlling it. We must strive to ensure that critical systems supporting our society run on technology we fully understand and can influence.
