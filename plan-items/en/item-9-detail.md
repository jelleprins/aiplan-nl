# **Research on AI Impact**

Start a national program that researches the impact of AI on the economy, education, democracy, and security. Connect researchers with policymakers and companies to develop scenarios that provide direct input for policy and strategy.

We must not only invest in the technology itself but also in understanding its societal consequences. This requires multidisciplinary research where technologists, social scientists, ethicists, and legal experts work together to map and guide the various aspects of AI impact.
